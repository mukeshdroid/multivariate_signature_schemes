### Abstract
Shor’s Algorithm, unveiled in 1994, assisted in an era where quantum computers could efficiently
factorize numbers. With quantum hardware becoming tangible, it has become increasingly
imperative to seek cryptosystems that don’t rely on number theory’s traditional properties such
as factorization and discrete logarithms to ensure data security and robust digital signatures
in the post-quantum landscape. We explore the multivariate signature schemes which offers
versatile applications in asymmetric signatures, encryption, and authentication. Along with
which we look at the python implementation of signature schemes such as C*.
